Introduction
--------------------------
Python is a programming language that helps in automating instructions to the computer in a variety of contexts, including security contexts. 
Writing code in Python is a valuable skill that helps security analysts thrive in their technical work.
In this lab, you'll practice writing your first Python code while learning about a notebook environment. 
The hands-on practice you engage in throughout the labs will help you apply Python coding skills to your work as a security analyst. 
You'll benefit the most from the labs if you make sure to not only write in the cells that you're prompted to fill in, but also analyze all the cells thoroughly.

Scenario
--------------------------
As a security analyst, you'll often use notebook environments and notebooks to write and run code. 
This lab will help you get familiar with working in a notebook environment, writing code comments in Python, and displaying strings with the print() function.
In this lab, you'll complete a series of tasks that involve observing and running some pre-written cells of text and code, as well as filling in cells with your own text, Python code, and code comments.
