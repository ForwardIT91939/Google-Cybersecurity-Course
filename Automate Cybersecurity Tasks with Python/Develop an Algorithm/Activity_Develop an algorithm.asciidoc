== Activity: Develop an algorithm

== Introduction

An algorithm is a set of steps that can be used to solve a problem.
Security analysts develop algorithms to provide the solutions that they
need for their work. For example, an analyst may work with users who
bring them devices. The analyst may need an algorithm that first checks
if a user is approved to access the system and then checks if the device
that they have brought is the one assigned to them.

In this lab, you’ll develop an algorithm in Python that automates this
process.

Tips for completing this lab

As you navigate this lab, keep the following tips in mind:

* `### YOUR CODE HERE ###` indicates where you should write code. Be
sure to replace this with your own code before running the code cell.
* Feel free to open the hints for additional guidance as you work on
each task.
* To enter your answer to a question, double-click the markdown cell to
edit. Be sure to replace the ``[Double-click to enter your responses
here.]'' with your own answer.
* You can save your work manually by clicking File and then Save in the
menu bar at the top of the notebook.
* You can download your work locally by clicking File and then Download
and then specifying your preferred file format in the menu bar at the
top of the notebook.

== Scenario

In this lab, you’re working as a security analyst and you’re responsible
for developing an algorithm that connects users to their assigned
devices. You’ll write code that indicates if a user is approved on the
system and has brought their assigned device to the security team.

== Task 1

You’ll work with a list of approved usernames along with a list of the
approved devices assigned to these users. The elements of the two lists
are synchronized. In other words, the user at index `0` in
`approved_users` uses the device at index `0` in `approved_devices`.
Later, this will allow you to verify if the username and device ID
entered by a user correspond to each other.

First, to explore how indices in lists work, run the following code cell
as is and observe the output. Then, replace each `0` with another index
and run the cell to observe what happens.


+*In[1]:*+
[source, ipython3]
----
# Assign `approved_users` to a list of approved usernames

approved_users = ["elarson", "bmoreno", "tshah", "sgilmore", "eraab"]

# Assign `approved_devices` to a list of device IDs that correspond to the usernames in `approved_users`

approved_devices = ["8rp2k75", "hl0s5o1", "2ye3lzg", "4n482ts", "a307vir"]

# Display the element at the specified index in `approved_users`

print(approved_users[0])

# Display the element at the specified index in `approved_devices`

print(approved_devices[0])

----


+*Out[1]:*+
----
elarson
8rp2k75
----

== *Question 1*

*What did you observe about the output when `approved_users[0]` is
displayed and when `approved_devices[0]` is displayed? What happens when
you replace each `0` with another index?*

Using the index 0 - we are able to output the first item in the list for
both users and devices. Changing the index will cause the output to
display a different print correspondant to the number given.

== Task 2

There’s a new employee joining the organization, and they need to be
provided with a username and device ID. In the following code cell, you
are given a username and device ID of this new user, stored in the
variables `new_user` and `new_device`, respectively. Use the `.append()`
method to add these variables to the `approved_users` and
`approved_devices` respectively. Afterwards, display the
`approved_users` and `approved_devices` variables to confirm the added
information. Be sure to replace each `### YOUR CODE HERE ###` with your
own code before you run the following cell.


+*In[5]:*+
[source, ipython3]
----
# Assign `approved_users` to a list of approved usernames

approved_users = ["elarson", "bmoreno", "tshah", "sgilmore", "eraab"]

# Assign `approved_devices` to a list of device IDs that correspond to the usernames in `approved_users`

approved_devices = ["8rp2k75", "hl0s5o1", "2ye3lzg", "4n482ts", "a307vir"]

print("Before the change - Users:", approved_users)
print("Before the change - Devices:", approved_devices)
# Assign `new_user` to the username of a new approved user

new_user = "gesparza"

# Assign `new_device` to the device ID of the new approved user

new_device = "3rcv4w6"

# Add that user's username and device ID to `approved_users` and `approved_devices` respectively

approved_users.append(new_user)
approved_devices.append(new_device)

# Display the contents of `approved_users`

print("After the change - Users:", approved_users)

# Diplay the contents of `approved_devices`

print("After the change - Devices:", approved_devices)

----


+*Out[5]:*+
----
Before the change - Users: ['elarson', 'bmoreno', 'tshah', 'sgilmore', 'eraab']
Before the change - Devices: ['8rp2k75', 'hl0s5o1', '2ye3lzg', '4n482ts', 'a307vir']
After the change - Users: ['elarson', 'bmoreno', 'tshah', 'sgilmore', 'eraab', 'gesparza']
After the change - Devices: ['8rp2k75', 'hl0s5o1', '2ye3lzg', '4n482ts', 'a307vir', '3rcv4w6']
----

Hint 1

Use the `.append()` method to add `new_user` to `approved_users`.

Use the `.append()` method to add `new_device` to `approved_devices`.

Hint 2

Use the `print()` function to display the contents of `approved_users`.

Use the `print()` function to display the contents of
`approved_devices`.

== *Question 2*

*After the new approved user is added, what did you observe about the
output when `approved_users` is displayed and when `approved_devices` is
displayed?*

After changing a few lines of code, i was able to display both the
before and after the change from the append command. We are ablte to see
that after the append command we have successfully added a new user and
device.

== Task 3

An employee has left the team and should no longer have access to the
system. In the following code cell, you are given the username and
device ID of the user to be removed, stored in the variables
`removed_user` and `removed_device` respectively. Use the `.remove()`
method to remove each of these elements from the corresponding list.
Afterwards, display both the `approved_users` and the `approved_devices`
variables to view the removed users. Run the code and observe the
results. Be sure to replace each `### YOUR CODE HERE ###` with your own
code before you run the following cell.


+*In[8]:*+
[source, ipython3]
----
# Assign `approved_users` to a list of approved usernames

approved_users = ["elarson", "bmoreno", "tshah", "sgilmore", "eraab", "gesparza"]

# Assign `approved_devices` to a list of device IDs that correspond to the usernames in `approved_users`

approved_devices = ["8rp2k75", "hl0s5o1", "2ye3lzg", "4n482ts", "a307vir", "3rcv4w6"]

print("Before the change - Users:", approved_users)
print("Before the change - Devices:", approved_devices)

# Assign `removed_user` to the username of the employee who has left the team

removed_user = "tshah"

# Assign `removed_device` to the device ID of the employee who has left the team

removed_device = "2ye3lzg"

# Remove that employee's username and device ID from `approved_users` and `approved_devices` respectively

approved_users.remove(removed_user)
approved_devices.remove(removed_device)

# Display `approved_users`

print("After the change - Users:", approved_users)

# Diplay `approved_devices`

print("After the change - Devices:", approved_devices)

----


+*Out[8]:*+
----
Before the change - Users: ['elarson', 'bmoreno', 'tshah', 'sgilmore', 'eraab', 'gesparza']
Before the change - Devices: ['8rp2k75', 'hl0s5o1', '2ye3lzg', '4n482ts', 'a307vir', '3rcv4w6']
After the change - Users: ['elarson', 'bmoreno', 'sgilmore', 'eraab', 'gesparza']
After the change - Devices: ['8rp2k75', 'hl0s5o1', '4n482ts', 'a307vir', '3rcv4w6']
----

Hint 1

Use the `.remove()` method to remove `removed_user` from
`approved_users`.

Use the `.remove()` method to remove `removed_device` from
`approved_devices`.

Hint 2

Use the `print()` function to display the contents of `approved_users`.

Use the `print()` function to display the contents of
`approved_devices`.

== *Question 3*

*After the user who left the team is removed, what did you observe about
the output when `approved_users` is displayed and when
`approved_devices` is displayed?*

We were able to remove the deleted user along with the correspondant
device.

== Task 4

As part of verifying a user’s identity in the system, you’ll need to
check if the user is one of the approved users. Write a conditional
statement that verifies if a given username is an element of the list of
approved usernames. If it is, display
`"The user ______ is approved to access the system."`. Otherwise,
display `"The user ______ is not approved to access the system."`. Be
sure to replace each `### YOUR CODE HERE ###` with your own code before
you run the following cell.


+*In[9]:*+
[source, ipython3]
----
# Assign `approved_users` to a list of approved usernames

approved_users = ["elarson", "bmoreno", "sgilmore", "eraab", "gesparza"]

# Assign `approved_devices` to a list of device IDs that correspond to the usernames in `approved_users`

approved_devices = ["8rp2k75", "hl0s5o1", "4n482ts", "a307vir", "3rcv4w6"]

# Assign `username` to a username

username = "sgilmore"

# Conditional statement
# If `username` belongs to `approved_users`, then display "The user ______ is approved to access the system."
# Otherwise display "The user ______ is not approved to access the system."
if username in approved_users:
    print("The username", username, "is approved to access the system.")
else:
    print("The user", username, "is not approved to access the system.")
    
----


+*Out[9]:*+
----
The username sgilmore is approved to access the system.
----

Hint 1

In the `if` condition, be sure to check if `username` belongs to
`approved_users`.

Hint 2

After the `if` statement, use the `else` keyword to create an `else`
statement that handles the case when `username` is not part of the
`approved_users`.

Hint 3

Inside the `else` statement, use the `print()` function to display the
message `"The user ______ is not approved to access the system."`.

Refer to the `print()` function call in the `if` statement and observe
how commas separate a string containing the first part of the message,
the `username` variable, and another string containing the second part
of the message.

== *Question 4*

*What message do you observe in the output when `username` is
`"sgilmore"`?*

The output of this script displays that the username - sgilmore is an
approved user.

== Task 5

The next part of the algorithm uses the `.index()` method to find the
index of `username` in the `approved_users` and store that index in a
variable named `ind`.

When used on a list, the `.index()` method will return the position of
the given value in the list.

Add a statement to display `ind` in the following code cell to explore
the value it contains. Be sure to replace the `### YOUR CODE HERE ###`
with your own code before you run the following cell.


+*In[10]:*+
[source, ipython3]
----
# Assign `approved_users` to a list of approved usernames

approved_users = ["elarson", "bmoreno", "sgilmore", "eraab", "gesparza"]

# Assign `approved_devices` to a list of device IDs that correspond to the usernames in `approved_users`

approved_devices = ["8rp2k75", "hl0s5o1", "4n482ts", "a307vir", "3rcv4w6"]

# Assign `username` to a username

username = "sgilmore"

# Assign `ind` to the index of `username` in `approved_users`

ind = approved_users.index(username)

# Display the value of `ind`

print(ind)

----


+*Out[10]:*+
----
2
----

Hint 1

Use the `print()` function to display the value of `ind`.

== *Question 5*

*What do you observe from the output when `username` is `"sgilmore"`?*

When entering the print command we are able to see that the ind was able
to detect the position of username sgilmore is in the 3rd position of
the list - (2)

== Task 6

This task will allow you to build your understanding of list operations
for the algorithm that you’ll eventually build. It will demonstrate how
you can find an index in one list and then use this index to display
connected information in another list. First, use the `.index()` method
again to find the index of `username` in the `approved_users` and store
that in a variable named `ind`. Then, connect `ind` to the
`approved_devices` and display the device ID located at the index `ind`.
Afterwards, run the cell to observe the result. Be sure to replace each
`### YOUR CODE HERE ###` with your own code before you run the following
cell.


+*In[11]:*+
[source, ipython3]
----
# Assign `approved_users` to a list of approved usernames

approved_users = ["elarson", "bmoreno", "sgilmore", "eraab", "gesparza"]

# Assign `approved_devices` to a list of device IDs that correspond to the usernames in `approved_users`

approved_devices = ["8rp2k75", "hl0s5o1", "4n482ts", "a307vir", "3rcv4w6"]

# Assign `username` to a username

username = "sgilmore"

# Assign `ind` to the index of `username` in `approved_users`

ind = approved_users.index(username)

# Display the device ID at the index that matches the value of `ind` in `approved_devices`

print(approved_devices[ind])
    
----


+*Out[11]:*+
----
4n482ts
----

Hint 1

Use the `.index()` method to get the index value of the `username` in
the `approved_users`. Assign `ind` to the result.

Hint 2

To display the correct device ID from `approved_devices`, use `ind` as
the index. Place `ind` inside the square brackets to extract the correct
element from `approved_devices`.

== *Question 6*

*What do you observe from the output when `username` is `"sgilmore"`?*

When inputting the print command for approved devices after specifying
the index from username in the approved list - the script outputs the
corresponded approved device for inputted username

== Task 7

Your next step in creating the algorithm is to determine if a username
and device ID correspond. To do this, write a conditional that checks if
the `username` is an element of the `approved_devices` and if the
`device_id` stored at the same index as `username` matches the
`device_id` entered. You’ll use the logical operator `and` to connect
the two conditions. When both conditions evaluate to `True`, display a
message that the username is approved and another message that the user
has their assigned device. Be sure to replace each
`### YOUR CODE HERE ###` with your own code before you run the following
cell.


+*In[13]:*+
[source, ipython3]
----
# Assign `approved_users` to a list of approved usernames

approved_users = ["elarson", "bmoreno", "sgilmore", "eraab", "gesparza"]

# Assign `approved_devices` to a list of device IDs that correspond to the usernames in `approved_users`

approved_devices = ["8rp2k75", "hl0s5o1", "4n482ts", "a307vir", "3rcv4w6"]

# Assign `username` to a username

username = "sgilmore"

# Assign `device_id` to a device ID

device_id = "4n482ts"

# Assign `ind` to the index of `username` in `approved_users`

ind = approved_users.index(username)

# Conditional statement
# If `username` belongs to `approved_users`, and if the device ID at `ind` in `approved_devices` matches `device_id`,
# then display a message that the username is approved,
# followed by a message that the user has the correct device

if username in approved_users and approved_devices:
    print("The username", username, "is approved to access the system.")
    print(device_id, "is the assigned device for", username)

----


+*Out[13]:*+
----
The username sgilmore is approved to access the system.
4n482ts is the assigned device for sgilmore
----

Hint 1

After the logical operator `and`, write the second condition in the `if`
statement using a comparison operator to check whether the element at
`ind` in `approved_devices` matches `device_id`.

Hint 2

Use the `==` comparison operator to check whether the element at `ind`
in `approved_devices` matches `device_id`.

== *Question 7*

*What do you observe from the output when `username` is `"sgilmore"` and
`device_id` is `"4n482ts"`?*

If the username corresponds with the correct device id - the script will
print out the following if command due to no other else statement
provided. Output: The username sgilmore is approved to access the
system. 4n482ts is the assigned device for sgilmore

== Task 8

It would also be helpful for users to receive messages when their
username is not approved or their device ID is incorrect.

Add to the code by writing an `elif` statement. This `elif` statement
should run when the `username` is part of the `approved_users` but the
`device_id` doesn’t match the corresponding device ID in the
`approved_devices`. The statement should also display two messages
conveying that information.

Be sure to replace each `### YOUR CODE HERE ###` with your own code
before you run the following cell.

(After you run the code once with a `device_id` of `"4n482ts"`, you
might want to explore what happens if you assign a different value to
`device_id`.)


+*In[16]:*+
[source, ipython3]
----
# Assign `approved_users` to a list of approved usernames

approved_users = ["elarson", "bmoreno", "sgilmore", "eraab", "gesparza"]

# Assign `approved_devices` to a list of device IDs that correspond to the usernames in `approved_users`

approved_devices = ["8rp2k75", "hl0s5o1", "4n482ts", "a307vir", "3rcv4w6"]

# Assign `username` to a username

username = "sgilmore"

# Assign `device_id` to a device ID

device_id = "4n482ts"

# Assign `ind` to the index of `username` in `approved_users`

ind = approved_users.index(username)

# If statement
# If `username` belongs to `approved_users`, and if the element at `ind` in `approved_devices` matches `device_id`,
# then display a message that the username is approved,
# followed by a message that the user has the correct device

if username in approved_users and device_id == approved_devices[ind]:
    print("The user", username, "is approved to access the system.")
    print(device_id, "is the assigned device for", username)

# Elif statement
# Handles the case when `username` belongs to `approved_users` but element at `ind` in `approved_devices` does not match `device_id`,
# and displays two messages accordingly

elif username in approved_users and device_id != approved_devices[ind]:
    print("The user", username, "is approved to access the system, but", device_id, "is not their assigned device.")

----


+*Out[16]:*+
----
The user sgilmore is approved to access the system.
4n482ts is the assigned device for sgilmore
----

Hint 1

In the `elif` statement, use the `in` operator to check whether
`username` belongs to `approved_users`, use a comparison operator to
check whether the element at `ind` in `approved_devices` doesn’t match
`device_id`, and use a logical operator to connect these two conditions
to check whether both of them are met.

Hint 2

In the `elif` statement, use the `in` operator to check whether
`username` belongs to `approved_users`, use the `!=` comparison operator
to check whether the element at `ind` in `approved_devices` doesn’t
match `device_id`, and use the `and` logical operator to connect these
two conditions to check whether both of them are met.

== *Question 8*

*What do you observe from the output when `username` is `"sgilmore"` and
`device_id` is `"4n482ts"`?*

The output of the command remains the same due to the parameter being
true. However, the output will change the elif command if the parameters
are False

== Task 9

In this task, you’ll complete your algorithm by developing a function
that uses some of the code you’ve written in earlier tasks. This will
automate the login process.

There are multiple ways to use conditionals to automate the login
process. In the following code, a nested conditional is used to achieve
the goals of the algorithm. There is a conditional statement inside of
another conditional statement. The outer conditional handles the case
when the `username` is approved and the case when `username` is not
approved. The inner conditional, which is placed inside the first `if`
statement, handles the case when the `username` is approved and the
`device_id` is correct, as well as the case when the `username` is
approved and the `device_id` is incorrect.

To complete this task, you must define a function named `login` that
takes in two parameters, `username` and `device_id`. Afterwards, call
the function and pass in different username and device ID combinations
to experiment and observe the function’s behavior. Be sure to replace
the `### YOUR CODE HERE ###` with your own code before you run the
following cell.


+*In[23]:*+
[source, ipython3]

# Assign `approved_users` to a list of approved usernames

approved_users = ["elarson", "bmoreno", "sgilmore", "eraab", "gesparza"]

# Assign `approved_devices` to a list of device IDs that correspond to the usernames in `approved_users`

approved_devices = ["8rp2k75", "hl0s5o1", "4n482ts", "a307vir", "3rcv4w6"]

# Define a function named `login` that takes in two parameters, `username` and `device_id`

def login(username, device_id):

    # If `username` belongs to `approved_users`,

    if username in approved_users:

        # then display "The user ______ is approved to access the system.",

        print("The user", username, "is approved to access the system.")

        # assign `ind` to the index of `username` in `approved_users`,

        ind = approved_users.index(username)

        # and execute the following conditional
        # If `device_id` matches the element at the index `ind` in `approved_devices`,

        if device_id == approved_devices[ind]:

          # then display "______ is the assigned device for ______"

          print(device_id, "is the assigned device for", username)

        # Otherwise,

        else:

          # display "______ is not their assigned device"

          print(device_id, "is not their assigned device.")

    # Otherwise (part of the outer conditional and handles the case when `username` does not belong to `approved_users`),

    else:

        # Display "The user ______ is not approved to access the system."

        print("The username", username, "is not approved to access the system.")

# Call the function you just defined to experiment with different username and device_id combinations

login("elarson", "hl0s5o1")
login("elarson", "8rp2k75")
login("eraab", "3rcv4w6")

----


+*Out[23]:*+
----
The user elarson is approved to access the system.
hl0s5o1 is not their assigned device.
The user elarson is approved to access the system.
8rp2k75 is the assigned device for elarson
The user eraab is approved to access the system.
3rcv4w6 is not their assigned device.
----

Hint 1

Use the `def` keyword to start the function definition.

Hint 2

After the `def` keyword, specify the name of the function, followed by
parantheses and a colon. Inside the parantheses, specify the parameters
that the function takes in.

To call the function, write the name of the function, followed by
parantheses, and pass in the username and device ID that you want to
experiment with.

Hint 3

After the `def` keyword, write `login(username, device_id):` to complete
the function definition header.

To call the function, write `login()`, and pass in the username and
device ID that you want to experiment with, separated by a comma. Keep
in mind that the arguments you pass in are string data.

== *Question 9*

*After Python enters the inner conditional, what happens when the
`device_id` is correct, and what happens when the `device_id` is
incorrect?*

WHen calling the defined command each answer changes. I have entered
some where the statements were all true and some where the device id was
true or false and when the login is true or false. All was processed
correctly from if and elif statements.

== Conclusion

*What are your key takeaways from this lab?*

Creating algorithms is fun and is quite engaging. I enjoyed this lab
very much.
