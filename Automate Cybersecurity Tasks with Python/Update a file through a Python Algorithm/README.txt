Portfolio: Update a file through a Python algorithm

Scenario:
You are a security professional working at a health care company. 
As part of your job, you're required to regularly update a file that identifies the employees who can access restricted content. 
The contents of the file are based on who is working with personal patient records. Employees are restricted access based on their IP address. 
There is an allow list for IP addresses permitted to sign into the restricted subnetwork. There's also a remove list that identifies which employees you must remove from this allow list.
Your task is to create an algorithm that uses Python code to check whether the allow list contains any IP addresses identified on the remove list. If so, you should remove those IP addresses from the file containing the allow list.

What will be covered:
Opening the file that contains the allow list
Read the file that contaains the allow list
Read the file contents
Convert the string into a list
Iterate through the remove list
Remove IP addresses that are on the remove list
Update the file with the revised list of IP addresses
