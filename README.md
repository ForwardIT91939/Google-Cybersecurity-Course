# Google-Cybersecurity-Course
(All projects completed throughout the Google Cybersecurity course)

Hello All!

This repository stores all projects completed throughout the Google Cybersecurity Course on Coursera

In this course, I have aquired foundational knowledge to prepare me for (entry-level) Cybersecurity Analyst roles and expanded my understanding on security concepts with inclusion on how enterprises protect data on a day-to-day basis
It also prepared me to take on Comptia's Sec+ Exam for an additional certificate to add to my arsenal

The course covered many domains which include (if not limited to):
- Security and Risk Management
- Assets, Threats, and Vulnerability Security
- Threat Analysis/Incident Detection and Response
- Network Security

Through these lessons I was able to learn about:
- Task automation w/ Python
- Firewall protocols and the importance of setting them up correctly
- A brief summary of SIEM Tools (Chronicle and Splunk)
- Foundational knowledge on SQL
- Network Protocol Analyzers (TCPDUMP)


This is currently unfinished and will be continously updated throughout the duration of the course
