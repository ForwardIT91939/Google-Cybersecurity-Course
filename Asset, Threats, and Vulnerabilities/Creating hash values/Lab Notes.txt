Activity: Create Hash Values
----------------------------
Objective:

In this lab, In this lab, I am tasked to create and evaluate the hash values for two files. 
Using Linux commands, I will have to calculate the hash of two files and observe any differences in the hashes produced. Then, determine if the files are the same, or different.
----------------------------
Tasks:
- List the contents of the home directory
- Compare the plain text of the two files presented for hashing
- Compute the sha256sum hash of the two separate files
- Compare the hashes provided to identify the differences
----------------------------
Task 1 - Generate hashes for files
  - Use the ls command to list the contents of the directory
    ls
  - Use the cat command to display the contents of the file1.txt file
    cat file1.txt
  - Use the cat command to display the contents of the file2.txt file
    cat file2.txt

  OUTPUT: 
  analyst@4fb6d613b6b0:-$ cat file1.txt
  X5O!P%@AP[4\PZX54(P^)7CC)7}$EICAR-STANDARD-ANTIVIRUS-TEST-FILE!$H+H*
  analyst@4fb6d613b6b0:-$ cat file2.txt
  X5O!P%@AP[4\PZX54(P^)7CC)7}$EICAR-STANDARD-ANTIVIRUS-TEST-FILE!$H+H*

  - Use the sha256sum command to generate the has of the file1.txt file
    sha256sum file1.txt
  - Use the sha256sum command to generate the hash of the file2.txt file
    sha256sum file2.txt

  OUTPUT:
  analyst@4fb6d613b6b0:-$ sha256sum file1.txt
  131f95c51cc819465fa1797f6ccacf9d494aaaff46fa3eac73ae63ffbdfd8267  file1.txt
  analyst@4fb6d613b6b0:-$ sha256sum file2.txt
  2558ba9a4cad1e69804ce03aa2a029526179a91a5e38cb723320e83af9ca017b  file2.txt
----------------------------
Task 2 - Compare Hashes
  - Use the sha256sum command to generate the hash of the file1.txt file, and send the output to a new file called file1hash
    sha256sum file.txt >> file1hash
  - Use the sha256sum command to generate the hash of the file2.txt file, and send the output to a new file called file2hash
    sha256sum file2.txt >> file2hash
  - Use the cat command to display the hash values in the file1hash and file2hash files
    cat file1hash
    cat file2hash
  - Inspect the output and note the difference in the hash values
    [inspect] - no action needed just read
  - Use the cmp command to highlight the differences in the file1hash and file2hash files
    cmp file1hash file2hash
  - Review the output, which reports the first diffeence beteen the two files
    analyst@4fb6d613b6b0:-$ cmp file1hash file2hash
    file1hash file2hash differ: char1, line 1
