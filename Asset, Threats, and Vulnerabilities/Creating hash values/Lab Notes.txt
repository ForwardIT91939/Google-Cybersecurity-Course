Activity: Create Hash Values
----------------------------
Objective:

In this lab, In this lab, I am tasked to create and evaluate the hash values for two files. 
Using Linux commands, I will have to calculate the hash of two files and observe any differences in the hashes produced. Then, determine if the files are the same, or different.
----------------------------
Tasks:
- List the contents of the home directory
- Compare the plain text of the two files presented for hashing
- Compute the sha256sum hash of the two separate files
- Compare the hashes provided to identify the differences
