Scenario:
You work for an educational technology company that developed an application to help teachers automatically grade assignments. 
The application handles a wide range of data that it collects from academic institutions, instructors, parents, and students.
Your team was alerted to a data leak of internal business plans on social media. 
An investigation by the team discovered that an employee accidentally shared those confidential documents with an external business partner. 
An audit into the leak is underway to determine how similar incidents can be avoided.
A supervisor provided you with information regarding the leak. 
It appears that the principle of least privilege was not observed by employees at the company during a sales meeting.
You have been asked to analyze the situation and find ways to prevent it from happening again.
----------------------------------
Baseline Information - Review the following incident summary provided by your supervisor:
A customer success representative received access to a folder of internal documents from a manager. 
It contained files associated with a new product offering, including customer analytics and marketing materials. 
The manager forgot to unshare the folder. Later, the representative copied a link to the marketing materials to share with a business partner during a sales call. 
Instead, the representative shared a link to the entire folder. During the sales call, the business partner received the link to internal documents and posted it to their social media page.
