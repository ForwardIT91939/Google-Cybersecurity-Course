Perform a SQL Query
--------------------------------------------
Baseline Information:
In this lab, you’ll learn how to retrieve information from a database using SQL. You’ll be using the MariaDB shell to run your SQL queries.
You have to determine which employee devices must be updated. You also need to investigate user login activity to explore if any unusual activity has occurred.
The information you need is located in the machines and login_attempts tables in the organization database

Tasks - 
  1) Return informatio on employee devices
  2) Examine login attempts
  3) Sort the data returned froma query
--------------------------------------------
First Task - Retrieve employee device data
  - Run the following query to select all device information from the machines table
    SELECT *
    FROM machines;
  - Run the following query to select only the device_id and email_client columns from the machines table. Replace X with device_id and Y with email_client:
    SELECT device_id, email_client FROM machines;
  - Complete the query to return only the device_id, operating_system, and OS_patch_date columns from the machines table. Replace X, Y, and Z with the columns that you need to return
    SELECT device_id, operating_system, OS_patch_date FROM machines;
--------------------------------------------
Second Task - Investigate login activity
  - Write a SQL query to select the event_id and country columns from the log_in_attempts table
    SELECT event_id, country
    FROM log_in_attempts;
  - Write a SQL query that selects the username, login_date, and login_time columns from the log_in_attempts table
    SELECT username, login_date, login_time
    FROM log_in_attempts;
  - Write a SQL query that selects all columns from the log_in_attempts table, using a single symbol after the SELECT keyword
    SELECT *
    FROM log_in_attempts;
--------------------------------------------
Third Task - Order login attempts data
  - Run the following query, which orders log_in_attempts data by login_date
    SELECT *
    FROM log_in_attempts
    ORDER BY login_date;
  - Modify the query from the previous step by adding the login time to the ORDER BY clause. You must replace X with the appropriate column name
    SELECT * 
    FROM log_in_attempts
    ORDER BY login_date, login_time;
