Linux Bash Notes

Linux has many distrubutions - each distribution comes from a parent distro
Kali, Ubuntu, and Parot - Debian
CentOS - Redhat
----------------------
Each distribution has different package managers
Red Hat - Red Hat Package Manager (RPM) = .rpm
Debian - dpkg = .deb
----------------------
Advanced Package Tool (APT) - Debian Distro - Command-line interface to manage, search and install packages
Yellowdog Updator Modified (YUM) - Red Hat Distro - command-line interface to manage, search, and install packages (.rpm)
----------------------
Shell - command-line interperter = shell executes many internal processes to interpret your command
There are different types of shells just like different types of linux distros:
----------------------
Bourne-Again Shell (bash)
C-Shell (csh)
Korn Shell (ksh)
Enhanced C Shell (tcsh)
Z Shell (zsh)
----------------------
Linux Shells use Linux Commands but they differ in features
ksh and bash - $
zsh - %

Bash = default shell in most Linux distributions
----------------------
Standard input - information received by OS via command line
echo - Linux command that outputs string
String - ordered sequence of characters (like a sentence or word)

asdfasdf@sdlkafaslkdjf:-$ echo hello - [enter]
output = echo 
  - this is basically print ("hello world") - (Python)
----------------------
Filesystem Hirerarchy Standard (FHS)
Root directory is the highest level directory in Linux - it is represented by a single "/"
for example: /home/dud
the first slash represents root 
then it branches out to a subdirectory called home
the next "/" represents that it is branching out again
to the dud subdirectory
/home - each user in the system gets their own home directory
/bin - this direcory stands for "binary" and contains binary files and other executables
  *Executables are files that contain a series of commands a computer needs to follow to run programs and perform other functions
/etc - this directory stores the system's configuration files
/tmp - this directory stores many temporary files (Like windows %appdata% temp file)
/mnt - this directory stands for "mount" and stores media, such as USB drives and hard drives

  *FUNFACT - use man hier command to learn more about FHS
-----------------------
pwd - prints the working directory onto the screen
  *within pwd you can find out the username of user using [whoami] command which displays current user
ls - (list) displays the names of files and directories in the current working directory
cd - (change directory) navigates between directories
  *within cd you can change directories by using [.] for example using [cd..] will bring your file folder one level up in the structure
cat - displays the content of a file
head - (when you dont want to display all the content of a file) displays just the beginning of a file, by default 10 lines
tail - returns/displays the end of a file, by default 10 lines
less - returns the content of a file one page at a time
  *With the less command you get several keyboard functions/controls)
    - [space] - Move forward one page
    - [b] - Move back one page
    - [down arrow] - Move forward one line
    - [up arrow] - Move back one line
    - [q] - quit and return to previous terminal window
-----------------------
grep - searches a specified file and returns all liines in the file containing a specified string
| - (piping) sends the standarrd output of one command as standard input to another command for further processing
  *for example = ls /home/analyst/reports | grep user
    - The first command ls will list everything within arguemtn (Reports) but instead of outputting that - it is sent to the next line of code because of "|" which is piping the previous command to the next which is grep
find - find command searches for directories and files that meet specified criteria
-name or -iname - find a file or diectory names that contain specific string
  *within find, you can use -name or -iname to find file or directory names that contain a specific string. The spcific string you;re searching for must be entered in quotes
    - the difference between -name and -iname is that -name is case senstive and -iname is not
    - An asterick (*) is used as a wildcard to represent zero or more unknown characters 
      - for example "*log*" - find /home/analyst/projects -iname "*log*
-mtime - find files or directories last modified at a certain time frame
  *within find you can use this to find certain directories that was modified at a specified time fram 
    - for example if you put -mtime -3 it would search for directories that were last modified within 3 days
-mmin - can be used instead of -mtime to base the search on minutes rather than days
-------------------------
mkdir - Creates a new Directory
rmdir - Removes, or deletes a directory
touch - creates new file
rm - Removes or deletes a file
mv - moves a file or directory to a new location
cp - copies a file or directory into a new location
nano - command-line file editor 
  *if you would like to open anno you can enter nano followed by the file name
  *within nano you are able to creat new file by entering nano follwed by a file name
  *nano has keyboard shortcuts that can assist you - Ctrl + O will save a file | you can also use Ctrl + X to exit out of nano
-------------------------
Standard output redirection
In additon to the pipe (|), you can also use the right angle bracket (>) and double right angle bracket (>>) operators to redirect standard output
  *example: when used with echo, te > and >> operators can be used to send the output of echo to a specified filerather than the screen.
  *the difference between > and >> is that > overwrites your existing file, and >> adds your content to the end of the existing file instead of overwriting
  *example: echo "last updated date" >> permissions.txt - adds the string "last updated date" to the files contents
  *example: echo "time" > permissions.txt - will overwrite everything in permissions.txt with "time"
  *Both > and >> operators will create a new file if one doesn't already exist with your specified name
-------------------------
Permissions:

Linux has different permissions - they consist of:
read - read only
write - write file
execute - executable file

drwxrwxrwx - full permissions would look like this
d = Directory
1) rwx - user has read, write and executable permissions on this particular file
2) rwx - group has read, write and executable permissions on this particular file
3) rwx - other has read, write and executable permissions on this particular file
-rw-r--r-- - Would be an example of a file that has certain permissions activated (user has read, write)(group has read)(other has read)
--------------------------
Types of Users

user - when you create a file you are the owner of that file but the ownership can be changed
group - Multi-user environment
other - all other users on the system
--------------------------
Options - modify the behavior of the command
[ls -l] command - displays permissions to files and directories
[ls- a] command - displays hidden files
[ls -la] command - you can combine the two to display permissions to files and directories, including hidden files
--------------------------
Changing Permissions

chmod - (change mode) - command changes permissons on files and directories
example* chmod g+w.o-r access.txt
  * (user = u) (group = g) (other = o)
  * [+] = gain access  [-] = lose access  [=] = assign permissions for the user, group, or other
  ^example above shows that we are going to make changes in permissions for (usertype) groups and others
  group will gain write
  other will lose read
--------------------------
Root - A user with elevated privileges to modify the system
Root account is the most powerful account... you wouldnt want to be running linux with root often
  *This can lead to many problems such as:
    - Security risks: Malicious actors will try to breach into root accounts due to its powerful capabilites
    - Irreversible Mistakes: its very east to type the wrong command in the CLI, running in root you will have a higer risk of making irreversible mistake
    - Accountability: In a multi-user environment there will be many users. If a user is running as root, there is no way to rack who exactly ran a command
  *Thats where sudo comes in
Sudo - A command that temporarily grants elevated permissions to specific users
useradd - A command that adds users (ONLY root and sudo privileges can use useradd command)
userdel - A command that deletes users (ONLY root and sudo privileges can use userdel command)
