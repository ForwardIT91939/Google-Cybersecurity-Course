Apply more filters in SQL
----------------------------
Baseline Information:
Youâ€™re investigating a recent security incident.
You need to gather information about login attempts for certain dates and times. This will help in resolving a security incident.

Tasks:
- retrieve login events made after a certain date.
- narrow the focus of the search to filter logins in a date range.
- investigate logins that were made at certain times.
- filter login attempts based on their event IDs.
----------------------------
First Task - Retrieve login attempts after a certain date
  - Complete the SQL query to retrieve data for login attempts made after '2022-05-09'. Replace X with the correct operator:
    SELECT * 
    FROM log_in_attempts 
    WHERE login_date > '2022-05-09';
  
  - Complete the SQL query to retrieve data for login attempts that were made on or after '2022-05-09'. Replace X with the correct operator:
    SELECT * 
    FROM log_in_attempts 
    WHERE login_date >= '2022-05-09';  
----------------------------
Second Task - Retrieve logins in a date range
  - Run the query to retrieve the required records. You must insert the required dates X and Y:
    SELECT * 
    FROM log_in_attempts 
    WHERE login_date BETWEEN '2022-05-09' AND '2022-05-11';
----------------------------  
Third Task - Investigate logins at certain times
  - Write a SQL query to retrieve data for login attempts made before '07:00:00'
    SELECT *
    FROM log_in_attempts
    WHERE login_time < '07:00:00';

  - Modify the query to return logins between '06:00:00' and '07:00:00'.
    SELECT *
    FROM log_in_attempts
    WHERE login_time BETWEEN '06:00:00' AND '07:00:00';
---------------------------- 
Fourth Task - Investigate logins by event ID
(You need to investigate login attempts based on event ID numbers. With this query, you want to return only the event_id, username, and login_date fields from the log_in_attempts table.)
  - Write a query to return login attempts with event_id greater than or equal to 100.
    SELECT event_id, username, login_date
    FROM log_in_attempts
    WHERE event_id >= 100;
    
  - Modify the query to return only login attempts with event_id between 100 and 150.
    SELECT event_id, username, login_date
    FROM log_in_attempts
    WHERE event_id BETWEEN 100 AND 150;
