Filter a SQL Query
-------------------------
Baseline Information:
In this scenario, you need to get specific information about employees, their machines, and the departments they’re in. 
Your team needs this data to perform various tasks, such as running updates, posting a privacy notice in certain departments, and sending an alert to an employee with an issue on a machine.
You are responsible for finding the required information by querying a database. You’ll add filters to your queries to locate the information more quickly.

Tasks:
1) list all organization machines and their operating systems.
2) list all machines with the operating system OS 2.
3) list all the employees in the Finance and Sales departments.
4) obtain information about machines.
-------------------------
First Task - List all organization machines
  - Run a SQL query to retrieve only the device_id and operating_system columns from the machines table

    SELECT device_id, operating_system
    FROM machines;
-------------------------
Second Task - Retrieve a list of the machines with OS 2
  - Select all the records from the machines table with a value of 'OS 2' in the operating_system column. Replace the value X with the correct string:
    
    SELECT device_id, operating_system
    FROM machines 
    WHERE operating_system = 'OS 2';
-------------------------
Third Task - List employees in specific departments
  - Filter the rows returned from department column in the employees table to include only employees from the 'Finance' department. 
    Replace X with the appropriate column name and Y with the appropriate value to complete the filter:
    
    SELECT * 
    FROM employees 
    WHERE department = 'Finance';

  - Modify the previous query so that it returns employees who are in the 'Sales' department.

    SELECT * 
    FROM employees 
    WHERE department = 'Sales';
-------------------------
Fourth Task - Identify employee machines
  - Write a query to identify which employee uses the office in 'South-109'. (The data must be returned from the office column in the employees table.)

* My Original Answer: (ALSO CORRECT)
    SELECT * 
    FROM employees 
    WHERE office LIKE 'South%';
* Answer that was wanted:
    SELECT * 
    FROM employees 
    WHERE office = 'South-109';

  - Modify the query you used in the previous step so that it returns information on all the employees in the 'South' building. Use the LIKE operator with % in this query

    SELECT * 
    FROM employees 
    WHERE office LIKE 'South%';

(I may have used the wrong SQL command in my previous answer but I got the same answer...)
