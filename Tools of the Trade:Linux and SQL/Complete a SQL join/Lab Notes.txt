Complete a SQL Join
-------------------------
Baseline Information:
In this scenario, youâ€™ll investigate a recent security incident that compromised some machines.
You are responsible for getting the required information from the database for the investigation.

Tasks:
  - Use an inner join to identify which employees are using which machines
  - Use left and right joins to find machines that do not belong to any specific user 
    and users who do not have any specific machine assigned to them
  - Use an inner join to list all login attempts made by all employees.
-------------------------
First Task - Match employees to their machines
  - Run the following query to retrieve all records from the machines table:
    SELECT * 
    FROM machines;

  - Complete the query to perform an inner join between the machines and employees tables on the device_id column. 
    SELECT * 
    FROM machines 
    INNER JOIN employees ON machines.device_id = employees.device_id;
-------------------------
Second Task - Return more data
  - Run the following SQL query to connect the machines and employees tables through a left join. 
    SELECT * 
    FROM machines 
    LEFT JOIN employees ON machines.device_id = employees.device_id;

  - Run the following SQL query to connect the machines and employees tables through a right join.
    SELECT * 
    FROM machines
    RIGHT JOIN employees ON machines.device_id = employees.device_id;
-------------------------
Third Task - Retrieve login attempt data
  - Run the following SQL query to perform an inner join on the employees and log_in_attempts tables.
    SELECT * 
    FROM employees 
    INNER JOIN log_in_attempts ON employees.username = log_in_attempts.username;
