Filter with AND, OR, and NOT
--------------------------------
Baseline Information:
You need to obtain specific information about employees, their machines, and the departments they belong to from the database.
Your team needs data to investigate potential security issues and to update computers.
You are responsible for filtering the required information from the database.

Tasks:
- retrieve all failed login attempts after business hours.
- retrieve all login attempts that occurred on specific dates.
- retrieve logins that didn't originate in Mexico.
- retrieve information about certain employees in the Marketing department.
- retrieve information about employees in the Finance or the Sales department.
- obtain information about employees who are not in the Information Technology department.
--------------------------------
First Task - Retrieve after hours failed login attempts
  - Use the AND operator to retrieve the failed login attempts that occurred after business hours. Replace the X and Y with the correct values to filter for the records you need:
   (MySQL stores Boolean values as 1 for TRUE, and 0 for FALSE. This means that TRUE is represented as 1, and FALSE represented as 0 in the success column.)

(TRUE)
    SELECT *
    FROM log_in_attempts
    WHERE login_time > '18:00' AND success = 1;

(FALSE)
    SELECT *
    FROM log_in_attempts
    WHERE login_time > '18:00' AND success = 0;

--------------------------------
Second Task - Retrieve login attempts on specific dates
Your team is investigating a suspicious event that occurred on '2022-05-09'. You want to retrieve all login attempts that occurred on this day and the day before ('2022-05-08').
The login_date column in the log_in_attempts table contains information on the dates when login attempts were made.

  - Use the OR operator to retrieve the failed login attempts on the specified days. Replace the X and Y with the correct values to filter for the records you need:

    SELECT * 
    FROM log_in_attempts 
    WHERE login_date = '2022-05-08' OR login_date = '2022-05-09';

--------------------------------
Third Task - Retrieve login attempts outside of Mexico
Now, your team is investigating logins that did not originate in Mexico, and you need to find this information. 
Note that the country field includes entries with 'MEX' and 'MEXICO'. You should use the NOT and LIKE operators and the matching pattern 'MEX%'.

  - Run the following SQL query to retrieve login attempts that did not originate in Mexico. Replace X with the correct operator and Y with the correct pattern to filter for the information you need:

    SELECT * 
    FROM log_in_attempts
    WHERE NOT country LIKE 'MEX%';

--------------------------------
Fourth Task - Retrieve employees in Marketing
For tasks 4, 5 and 6 you need to retrieve the information from the department and office columns in the employees table.
You can run the following SQL query if you need to view the columns and values in the employees table:
SELECT * 
FROM employees;
Your team is updating employee machines, and you need to obtain the information about employees in the 'Marketing' department who are located in all offices in the East building (such as 'East-170' or 'East-320').

  - Write a SQL query to retrieve this information from the employees table. Select all columns and include filters on the department and office columns to return only the needed records.
    SELECT * 
    FROM employees;
    WHERE department = 'Marketing' AND office LIKE 'EAST%';

--------------------------------
Fifth Task - Retrieve employees in Finance or Sales
Now, your team needs to perform a different update to the computers of all employees in the Finance or the Sales department, and you need to locate information on these employees.
Note: Even though both conditions are based on the same column, you need to write out both full conditions. This means that you must specify department as the column in both conditions.

  - Write a SQL query to retrieve records for employees in the 'Finance' or the 'Sales' department.

    SELECT *
    FROM employees
    WHERE department - 'Finance' OR department = 'Sales';

--------------------------------
Sixth Task - Retrieve all employees not in IT
Your team needs to make one more update. This update was already made to employee computers in the Information Technology department. 
The team needs information about employees who are not in that department. 
You should use the NOT operator to identify these employees.

  - Write a SQL query to retrieve records for employees who are not in the 'Information Technology' department.
    SELECT *
    FROM employees
    WHERE NOT department = 'Information Technology';
