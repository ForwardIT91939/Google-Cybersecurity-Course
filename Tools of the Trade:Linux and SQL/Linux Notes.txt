Linux Notes

Linux has many distrubutions - each distribution comes from a parent distro
Kali, Ubuntu, and Parot - Debian
CentOS - Redhat

Each distribution has different package managers
Red Hat - Red Hat Package Manager (RPM) = .rpm
Debian - dpkg = .deb

Advanced Package Tool (APT) - Debian Distro - Command-line interface to manage, search and install packages
Yellowdog Updator Modified (YUM) - Red Hat Distro - command-line interface to manage, search, and install packages (.rpm)

Shell - command-line interperter = shell executes many internal processes to interpret your command
There are different types of shells just like different types of linux distros:

Bourne-Again Shell (bash)
C-Shell (csh)
Korn Shell (ksh)
Enhanced C Shell (tcsh)
Z Shell (zsh)

Linux Shells use Linux Commands but they differ in features
ksh and bash - $
zsh - %

Bash = default shell in most Linux distributions
