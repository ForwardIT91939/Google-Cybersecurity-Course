Portfolio Project - Applying filters to SQL Queries
In this project, I have been given a scenario where I am a Security Professional at a large organization. My task is to investigate security issues to help keep the system secure.
Within my time at the organzation I have discovered some potential security issues that involve login attempts and employee machines
I was tasked to examine the orgainzation's data in their employees and log_in_attempts tables.
Using SQL filters, demonstrated in this project, I have rerieved records from different datasets and investigated the portential security issues.

MariaDB [organization] - SQL Database was used
Commands Used:
