Analyze your first packet
------------------------
Tasks:
1) Open a Packet capture file using Wireshark
2) Examine packet information
3) Apply display filters
------------------------
Notes:
No. : The index number of the packet in this packet capture file
Time: The timestamp of the packet
Source: The source IP address
Destination: The destination IP address
Protocol: The protocol contained in the packet
Length: The total length of the packet
Info: Some infomation about the data in the packet (the payload) as interpreted by Wireshark
------------------------
1) Explore data with Wireshark

Note:
[The packet capture file has the Wireshark packet capture file icon, which shows a shark's fin swimming above three rows of binary digits. 
 The packet capture file has a .pcap file extension that is hidden by default by Windows Explorer and on the desktop view.]
[Not all the data packets are the same color. Coloring rules are used to provide high-level visual cues to help you quickly classify the different types of data. 
 Since network packet capture files can contain large amounts of data, you can use coloring rules to quickly identify the data that is relevant to you. 
 The example packet lists a group of light blue packets that all contain DNS traffic, followed by green packets that contain a mixture of TCP and HTTP protocol traffic.]

What is the protocol of the first packet in the list where the info column starts with the words 'Echo (ping) request'?
ICMP
------------------------
Apply a basic Wireshark filter and inspect a packet
  - Enter the following filter for traffic associated with a specific IP address
    ip.addr == 142.250.1.139

What is the TCP destination port of this TCP packet?
80
------------------------
Use filters to select packets
  - Enter the following filter to select traffic for a specific source IP address only
    ip.src == 142.250.1.139
  Note: A filtered list is returned with fewer entries than before. It contains only packets that came from 142.250.1.139
  - Enter the following filter to select traffic for a specific destination IP address only:
    ip.dst == 142.250.1.139
  Note: A filtered list is returned that contains only packets that were sent to 142.250.1.139
  - Enter the following filter to select traffic to or from a specific Ethernet MAC address
    eth.addr == 42:01:ac:15:e0:02
  Note: The MAC address you specified in the filter is listed as either the source or destination address in the expanded Ethernet II subtree
        The Protocol field in the Internet Protocol Version 4 subtree indicates which IP internal protocol is contained in the packet

What is the protocol contained in the Internet Protocol Version 4 subtree from the first packet related to MAC address 42:01:ac:15:e0:02?
TCP
------------------------
Use filters to explore DNS packets
  - Enter the following filter to select UDP port 53 traffic. DNS traffic uses UDP port 53, so this will list traffic related to DNS queries and responses only
    udp.port == 53
  Note: Youâ€™ll notice that the name of the website that was queried is opensource.google.com
        The Answers data includes the name that was queried (opensource.google.com) and the addresses that are associated with that name

Which of these IP addresses is displayed in the expanded Answers section for the DNS query for opensource.google.com?
142.250.1.139
------------------------
Use filters to explore TCP packets
  - Enter the following filter to select TCP port 80 traffic. TCP port 80 is the default port that is associated with web traffic
    tcp.port == 80

What is the Time to Live value of the packet as specified in the Internet Protocol Version 4 subtree?
64

What is the Frame Length of the packet as specified in the Frame subtree?
54 Bytes

What is the Header Length of the packet as specified in the Internet Protocol Version 4 subtree?
20 Bytes

What is the Destination Address as specified in the Internet Protocol Version 4 subtree?
169.254.169.254
(im a little confused with this one - It states that the Src is 169.254.169.254 and the Destination is 172.21.224.2)

  - Enter the following filter to select TCP packet data that contains specific text data
    tcp contains "curl"
Note: This filters to packets containing web requests made with the curl command in this sample packet capture file
