Step 3: Evaluate the search results
- VT CONTEXT: This section provides the VirusTotal information available for the domain. 
- WHOIS: This section provides a summary of information about the domain using WHOIS, a free and publicly available directory that includes information about registered domain names, 
         such as the name and contact information of the domain owner. 
         In cybersecurity, this information is helpful in assessing a domain's reputation and determining the origin of malicious websites. 
- Prevalence: This section provides a graph which outlines the historical prevalence of the domain. 
              This can be helpful when you need to determine whether the domain has been accessed previously. Usually, less prevalent domains may indicate a greater threat. 
- RESOLVED IPS: This insight card provides additional context about the domain, such as the IP address that maps to signin.office365x24.com, which is 40.100.174.34. 
                Clicking on this IP will run a new search for the IP address in Chronicle. 
                Insight cards can be helpful in expanding the domain investigation and further investigating an indicator to determine whether there is a broader compromise.
- SIBLING DOMAINS: This insight card provides additional context about the domain. 
                   Sibling domains share a common top or parent domain. 
                   For example, here the sibling domain is listed as login.office365x24.com, which shares the same top domain office365x24.com with the domain you're investigating: signin.office365x24.com.
- TIMELINE: This tab provides information about the events and interactions made with this domain. 
            Click EXPAND ALL to reveal the details about the HTTP requests made including GET and POST requests. 
            A GET request retrieves data from a server while a POST request submits data to a server.
- ASSETS: This tab provides a list of the assets that have accessed the domain.

Step 4: Investigate the threat intelligence data
  - Click on VT CONTEXT to analyze the available VirusTotal information about this domain. There is no VirusTotal information about this domain. To exit the VT CONTEXT window, click the X.
  - By Top Private Domain, click office365x24.com to access the domain view for office365x24.com. Click VT CONTEXT to assess the VirusTotal information about this domain.
  - In the pop up, you can observe that one vendor has flagged this domain as malicious. Exit the VT CONTEXT window. Click the back button in your browser to go back to the domain view for the signin.office365x24.com search.

Step 5: Investigate the affected assets and events
  - ASSETS: There are several different assets that have accessed the domain, along with the date and time of access. 
            Using your incident handler's journal, record the name and number of assets that have accessed the domain. 
  - TIMELINE: Click EXPAND ALL to reveal the details about the HTTP requests made, including GET and POST requests. 
              The POST information is especially useful because it means that data was sent to the domain. It also suggests a possible successful phish.
              Using your incident handler's journal, take note of the POST requests to the /login.php page. For more details about the connections, open the raw log viewer by clicking the open icon.

Step 6: Investigate the resolved IP addresses

      A. TIMELINE: Take note of the additional POST request. A new POST suggests that an asset may have been phished.
