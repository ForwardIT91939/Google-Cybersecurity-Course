Activity Overview:
---------------------------
In this activity, you'll focus on the two network protocol analyzers: Wireshark and tcpdump. Your goal is to gain a basic understanding of the Wireshark and tcpdump, how they work, and what their features are.
As you've learned, a network protocol analyzer (packet sniffer) is a tool designed to capture and analyze data traffic within a network. 
Network protocol analyzers help security analysts examine and understand the network traffic flows.
